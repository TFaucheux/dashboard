# Streamlit Dashboard Project

This project creates a simple dashboard using AI prompts.

## Shell Scripts

- [`INSTALL_PYTHON.sh`](https://github.com/TFaucheux/dashboard/blob/main/INSTALL_PYTHON.sh) - Installs Python 3 on macOS via Homebrew (if needed)

- [`CREATE_ENV.sh`](https://github.com/TFaucheux/dashboard/blob/main/CREATE_ENV.sh) - Creates virtual environment for dashboard app and installs dependencies via Pip

- [`RUNME.sh`](https://github.com/TFaucheux/dashboard/blob/main/RUNME.sh) - Executes Streamlit dashboard app 

## Git Information

- [`CREATE_REPO.sh`](https://github.com/TFaucheux/dashboard/blob/main/CREATE_REPO.sh) - Example of creating a new github repo from existing code.
- [`PUSH_CHANGES.sh`](https://github.com/TFaucheux/dashboard/blob/main/PUSH_CHANGES.sh) - Example of pushing changes from develop branch to main.

## Overview

This project was an experiment to create a simple dashboard using AI prompting provided through Claude.ai. The initial code was generated interactively through the Claude chat interface:

## Engineering Prompt sent to https://claude.ai/
---
"Could you please show me Python code for an interactive dashboard report with the ability to save as a PDF resembling a typical Morningstar report? The dashboard should include data tables, line graphs, bar charts, and a 9-box grid matrix graph.
The code should be modular with ample comments, the ability to read data from a CSV file, and styled outputs using coordinated colors from libraries like Streamlit and Seaborn.
Please include sample data to demonstrate real-world usage and complete CSS styling that would impress an audience. A logo in the top left corner and a map in the top center panel would also be ideal. Segmenting sections and graphs into panels is a nice touch.
The Python code should exemplify professional programming with comments, modularity, and maintainability. Please do your best to impress me with expert-level work!"

Some slight modifications to the initially generated code were required to get it to fully run. The process demonstrated the ability for AI assistants to provide detailed code snippets and examples through conversational prompts.

The scripts provided here fully automate setting up a Python environment, dependencies, and running a Streamlit dashboard app on a macOS system.
Let me know if you need any clarification or have feedback on improving this documentation!

Use this code for your own purposes, and at your own risk, no rights or responsibilities are implied or expressed.
I am in no way endorsing or affiliated with Claude.AI, use AI responsibily and protect any and all business assets and info.
(It is a good idea, to discuss the use of AI with your security team if you plan to use in a corporarte environment).

Happy Coding!
